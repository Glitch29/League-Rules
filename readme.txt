The goal of this project is to create a league structure with the following properties:

Fluid: A winning player can get from the bottom league to the top league in two seasons.

Robust: League behavior is still precisely defined if players are added or removed midseason or if matches are missed without replacement.

Stable:  Mid-season addition/removal/promotion minimally affects match scheduling.

Fair: Offseason addition/removal and league resizing creates minimal windfall gains or losses that are outside of players' control.

Scalable: League behavior adjusts well and is precisely defined for any number of total players.
